### Developing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to this project.

You can develop locally with
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/).

On Linux, the `kvm2` driver provides better performance than the default
`virtualbox` driver, but either will work:

```
minikube start --vm-driver=kvm2
```

`minikube start` will configure your `kubeconfig` for your local Minikube
cluster and set the current context to be for Minikube.
